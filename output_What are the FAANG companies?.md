## Summary



**FAANG Companies: An Overview**

The acronym FAANG originally referred to five prominent American technology companies: Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. However, over time, there have been changes in the composition of this group. Initially, it was FANG, which included Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. The "F" and "G" letters were dropped in 2015 and 2021, respectively, leading to variations like MAANG or other acronyms, though the original FAANG still refers to Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.

These companies are major players in their respective industries and have a significant impact on the stock market. Despite challenges such as Meta's financial struggles in its metaverse segment, Wall Street analysts continue to view these firms with optimism due to their innovative approaches and market leadership.

In summary, FAANG represents a group of influential tech companies that remain key entities in the global market landscape.
